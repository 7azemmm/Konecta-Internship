# 👨‍💻 Konnecta Internship Tasks

Welcome to my **Konnecta Internship** repository!  
This repo showcases all the tasks I completed as part of the **FullStack Internship Program** at [Konnecta](https://www.linkedin.com/company/konecta-group/posts/?feedView=all).

Each task is organized in its own directory with a dedicated `README.md` explaining the implementation, structure, and features in detail.
