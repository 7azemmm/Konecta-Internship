## 🛒 Summary

This is my first task for Konnecta Internship. Product List With Cart is a task from [frontend mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-list-with-cart-5MmqLVAp_d). It Built with HTML , CSS , JS.

## 🛒 Functionalities

This project implements a simple yet effective **Point of Sale (POS)** system with the following key features:

- **Add Products to Cart:** Users can see all products and add them to their shopping cart with quantity controls.
- **Discount Code Support:**  
  - `apply10` — Applies a 10% discount  
  - `apply25` — Applies a 25% discount
- **PDF Receipt Generation:** Generates a detailed, downloadable receipt using the `jsPDF` library, including all cart items and the final amount after discounts.
- **Optimized Performance:** Product images utilize **lazy loading** to speed up page load times and reduce bandwidth consumption.
- **Modular JavaScript Architecture:** Codebase is organized into well-separated modules (`main.js`, `uiHandlers.js`, etc.) for improved maintainability.
